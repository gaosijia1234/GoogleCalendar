# GoogleCalendar

## Summary 
In the project for our CS151 course at SJSU, we designed and implemented a calendar similar to the google calendar. We are expected to have obtained fundamental design and programming techniques to conduct this project, including MVC (Model/View/Controller) design pattern and GUI programming skills.

## Features 
Jump to today's date, go to next/prev month/day. Add events to a certain day, or to a recuring day or month. 
Show all the events created on a certain day or for a certain period.
